Goal - Analysis the use of facebook advertising by the main political parties in Northern Ireland.

1 - Collect data from the Facebook Ad Library API from the 6th of November, the official date the election started,
    to the 12th of December at 10pm, the date when polls closed. The political parties in the analysis will be
    the DUP, Sinn Fein, the SDLP, the UUP and the Alliance party.
        - Sinn Fein & the UUP didn't advertise during the election window in the UK.
2 - Basic research questions - how much did they spend, who did they target, what was the campaign message?
